# No Users Available - Testing Solutions

## üîç **Why No Users Are Showing**

The "Users" screen shows empty because:
1. **Only you have signed up** - The app excludes your own profile from the users list
2. **No other Google accounts** have signed into the app yet
3. **The query works correctly** - it's filtering out your own user ID as expected

## üß™ **Testing Solutions**

### **Option 1: Multiple Google Accounts (Recommended)**
1. **Sign out** from the current account:
   - Tap your profile picture ‚Üí "Sign Out"
2. **Sign in with a different Google account**:
   - Use another Gmail account you have access to
   - Or create a new Google account for testing
3. **Switch between accounts** to simulate multiple users

### **Option 2: Web Browser Testing**
```cmd
flutter run -d chrome
```
1. **Run the app in Chrome**
2. **Open multiple browser windows/tabs**
3. **Sign in with different Google accounts** in each window
4. **Test real-time messaging** between the windows

### **Option 3: Multiple Devices**
1. **Install the app on different devices** (phone, tablet, etc.)
2. **Sign in with different Google accounts** on each device

```cmd
# Create and start multiple Android emulators

## üîß **Development Testing Tips**

### **Create Test Data (Optional)**
If you want to create mock users for testing, you could:

1. **Temporarily modify the users query** to include test data
2. **Add sample users** directly to Firestore console
3. **Create a "Test Mode"** that shows mock users

### **Debug the User Loading**
Check if users are being created properly:

1. **Firebase Console**: Go to Firestore ‚Üí users collection
2. **Verify your user document** exists with correct data
3. **Check console logs** for any errors in user creation

## ‚ö° **Immediate Solution**

**Right now, to test the chat:**

1. **Open Chrome**: 
   ```cmd
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

2. **Copy the localhost URL** from terminal

3. **Open Incognito window**: Paste the same URL

4. **Sign in with different Google accounts** in each window

5. **Go to Users screen** in both windows - you should see each other
